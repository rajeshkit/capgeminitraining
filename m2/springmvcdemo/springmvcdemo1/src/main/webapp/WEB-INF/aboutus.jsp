<h1>About Capgemini</h1>
<h2>Capgemini was founded by Serge Kampf in 1967[9] as an enterprise management and data processing company. The company was founded as the Société pour la Gestion de l'Entreprise et le Traitement de l'Information (Sogeti).

In 1974 Sogeti acquired Gemini Computers Systems, a US company based in New York.[10] In 1975, having made two major acquisitions of CAP (Centre d'Analyse et de Programmation) and Gemini Computer Systems, and following resolution of a dispute with the similarly named CAP UK over the international use of the name 'CAP', Sogeti renamed itself as CAP Gemini Sogeti.[10]

Cap Gemini Sogeti launched US operations in 1981, following the acquisition of Milwaukee-based DASD Corporation, specializing in data conversion and employing 500 people in 20 branches throughout the US. Following this acquisition, The U.S. Operation was known as Cap Gemini DASD.[11]

In 1996, the name was simplified to Cap Gemini with a new group logo. All operating companies worldwide were re-branded to operate as Cap Gemini.[10]

Ernst & Young Consulting was acquired by Cap Gemini in 2000. It simultaneously integrated Gemini Consulting to form Cap Gemini Ernst & Young.[12]

In 2017, Cap Gemini S.A. became Capgemini SE, and its Euronext ticker name similarly changed from CAP GEMINI to CAPGEMINI.[13]

In July 2020, Capgemini reported that it has been named as a pioneer in Everest Group's Guidewire IT services called "Guidewire Services PEAK Matrix® Assessment 2020 – Setting the Key Phase on Cloud."[14]

In June 2021, Capgemini partners with Sanofi, Orange & Generali to launch Future4care, a European start-up accelerator focused on digital healthcare.[15][16]</h2>
